# cuda-checkpoint

NVIDIA's `cuda-checkpoint` works on single processes. Real GPU workloads — tensor parallelism, distributed training, multi-GPU inference — spawn multiple CUDA processes that must be checkpointed together. Lock all PIDs before checkpointing any, or NCCL deadlocks. This library solves that.

Suspends all GPU state (memory, CUDA graphs, contexts) to host memory and restores it later. The process stays alive — no serialization to disk, no model reloading. Works with any CUDA process: vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang, PyTorch training.

```
Before checkpoint:  GPU memory = 25 GB (model + KV cache + graphs)
After checkpoint:   GPU memory = 0 bytes (freed for other workloads)
After restore:      GPU memory = 25 GB (everything back, ready to serve)
```

## The multi-GPU problem

NVIDIA provides `cuda-checkpoint` — a CLI that checkpoints a single CUDA process. But most GPU workloads aren't a single process:

- **vLLM with TP=2**: 2 GPU worker processes + parent
- **vLLM with TP=4**: 4 GPU workers + parent
- **PyTorch DDP**: one process per GPU
- **Any NCCL workload**: multiple processes with shared GPU-side communicator state

You can't just checkpoint them one at a time. NCCL communicators create cross-process GPU state — if you checkpoint process A while process B is still running an allreduce, you deadlock. All processes must be locked before any are checkpointed.

This library handles that: discovers all CUDA-active PIDs in a process tree, locks them all, then checkpoints/restores in parallel.

## Quick start

```python
from cuda_checkpoint import CudaCheckpointAPI, MultiGPUCheckpointer, discover_cuda_pids

# Single process
api = CudaCheckpointAPI()
api.lock(pid)
api.checkpoint(pid)    # GPU memory -> host memory
api.restore(pid)       # host memory -> GPU memory
api.unlock(pid)

# Multi-GPU (parallel)
pids = discover_cuda_pids(server_pid)  # finds all CUDA-active PIDs in process tree
mgpu = MultiGPUCheckpointer(pids)     # parallel by default
mgpu.checkpoint()                      # all GPUs checkpointed concurrently
mgpu.restore()                         # all GPUs restored concurrently
```

## Install

```bash
pip install cuda-checkpoint

# With vLLM CLI integration
pip install cuda-checkpoint[vllm]
```

## Requirements

- Linux with NVIDIA driver 570+
- `cuda-checkpoint` binary from [NVIDIA/cuda-checkpoint](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-checkpoint)
- `CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER` environment variable (must be set before process starts)

For multi-GPU (NCCL):
```bash
export CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER
export NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE=0
export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1
```

## Results

36 experiments across 3 GPU architectures, 9 configurations, 3 models. All tests on Modal with real hardware. Full details in [WRITEUP.md](WRITEUP.md).

### Multi-GPU vLLM

### Stability

- **10-cycle stability**: zero memory leaks, 3.22s avg restore, all outputs identical ([benchmark](benchmarks/vllm_10cycle_stability.py))
- **Error recovery**: invalid PID, double checkpoint, double restore, rapid cycling — all handled safely ([benchmark](benchmarks/vllm_error_recovery.py))
- **Model-agnostic**: validated on Qwen2-7B, Qwen2-7B-AWQ, TinyLlama-1.1B
- **CUDA graphs**: survive checkpoint/restore on H100, 3x faster post-restore inference

### Generic layer (no vLLM)

Validated against raw PyTorch on T4 ([test](tests/modal_test_generic.py)):
- Tensor values survive checkpoint/restore
- `nn.Module` forward + backward pass work post-restore
- CUDA graphs replay correctly after restore
- 10.7 GB allocation, 5-cycle stable, 3.7 GB/s restore rate

### GPU recommendations

| GPU | CUDA graphs? | Expected cold start | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| H100 | Yes (recommended) | 4.0-5.0s | 3x faster post-restore inference |
| A100 | No (enforce-eager) | 3.5s | CUDA graphs add 4x restore overhead on A100 |
| L4 | No (enforce-eager) | 4.0s | Single GPU, inference 4.7x slower than H100 |

## Architecture

Two layers:

### `cuda_checkpoint` -- generic core

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `api.py` | `CudaCheckpointAPI` — ctypes bindings to the 4-step driver API (lock, checkpoint, restore, unlock) |
| `multi_gpu.py` | `MultiGPUCheckpointer` — locks all PIDs first, then checkpoints/restores in parallel via ThreadPoolExecutor |
| `discover.py` | `discover_cuda_pids()` — walks process tree, probes each PID for CUDA activity |

### `cuda_checkpoint_vllm` -- vLLM integration (optional)

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `orchestrator.py` | `VLLMCheckpointer` — sleep/wake optimization, V0/V1 engine detection |
| `discovery.py` | `find_vllm_server()` — auto-discovers running `vllm serve` |
| `cli.py` | `vllm-ckpt` CLI — discover, cycle, benchmark, watch (sidecar daemon), recommend |

## vLLM CLI

```bash
# Auto-discover and checkpoint/restore running vllm serve
vllm-ckpt cycle --port 8000 --model Qwen/Qwen2-7B

# Sidecar daemon (periodic checkpoint, SIGTERM-safe)
vllm-ckpt watch --port 8000 --interval 300 --json

# GPU-specific recommendations
vllm-ckpt recommend

# Benchmark
vllm-ckpt benchmark --port 8000 --model Qwen/Qwen2-7B --cycles 5
```
